# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Naive Bayes algorithm implemented in Python. To test the script you can use the .csv file named 'pima-indians-diabetes.data', which contains data from 'Pima Indians Diabetes Database'. Each record has a class value that indicates whether the patient suffered an onset of diabetes within 5 years of when the measurements were taken. 1 is for 'Yes' and 0 for 'No'.
